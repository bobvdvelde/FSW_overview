  <h1> A quick view of FSW collaboration and content-matches </h1>
  <h2> Department collaboration</h2>
  For an overview of inter-department collaboration we used the METIS output 'organisatiedeel naam' in publications.<br>
  This yielded the following network:
  <a href="http://bobvdvelde.github.io/FSW_dep_cooc/"><b>Inter-department cooperation</b></a> <br>
  <br>
  <h2> Department ties based on shared words in publication titles </h2>
  To get a sense of which departments share similar outputs, we generated an interactive network based on shared words in publication titles. <br>
  This is the following network:
  <a href="http://bobvdvelde.github.io/FSW_dep_by_key/"><b>Departments by shared keywords</b><a><br>
  <h2> Departments linked by common themes </h2>
  In 2013, the FSW drafted a overview of experts for each department, together with the broad themes they were working on. <br>
  This provides some insight into the departments as they officially participated in the same themes: <a href="http://bobvdvelde.github.io/dep_by_them/"><b>Departments by shared themes</b></a>
  <br>
  <h2> Official themes and their links based on the departments that use them </h2>
  Using the official roster of experts and their themes, we also drafted a network which links these themes based on their use within the same departments. <br>
  Clicking through the nodes, you can get a sense of which themes are used in which departments, and how limited the number of themes per department seems to be. <br>
