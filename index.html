  <h1> A quick view of FSW collaboration and content-matches </h1>
  <h2> Department collaboration</h2>
  For an overview of inter-department collaboration we used the METIS output 'organisatiedeel naam' in publications.<br>
  This yielded the following network:
  <a href="http://bobvdvelde.github.io/FSW_dep_cooc/"><b>Inter-department cooperation</b></a> <br>
  <br>
  <h2> Department ties based on shared words in publication titles </h2>
  To get a sense of which departments share similar outputs, we generated an interactive network based on shared words in publication titles. <br>
  This is the following network:
  <a href="http://bobvdvelde.github.io/FSW_dep_by_key/"><b>Departments by shared keywords</b><a><br>
